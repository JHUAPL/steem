# If this parameter is commented out or missing, or if the named file can't be
# loaded, no filters will be applied; STEEM will load all events.
#
# The filters file, if present, is a CSV file with 3 columns: a parameter
# name to filter on, the lower limit, and the upper limit for that parameter.
# The name is always required, but either or both limits may be blank. Any
# blank filters are simply ignored.
filters_file = launch/default/steem-filters.csv

# Help text file. If this parameter is commented out or missing, or if the
# named file can't be loaded this parameter is commented out, STEEM will
# provide some basic failsafe text if the help menu is activated.
help_file = launch/default/steem-help.txt

# Scatter plot definitions. If this parameter is commented out or missing, or
# if the named file can't be loaded this parameter is commented out,
# STEEM will show 3 plots on the main window:
#
#   1) sigma v. norm
#   2) altitude v. norm
#   3) altitude v. sigma
#
# The scatter plot file, if present, is a CSV format file with two columns, X
# and Y. This file specifies the names of the columns from the data set to use
# for X and Y on the scatter plots. A power user is thus not limited to just
# the three "standard" scatter plots listed above -- they can choose more or
# fewer plots, and have any columns for X and Y on the plots they wish to
# include.
scatter_plot_file = launch/default/steem-scatter.csv

# Force choice of display. If this parameter is commented out or missing,
# STEEM  will try to use the largest display available. If this parameter has
# an invalid display choice, it will "round off" the choice, i.e., if the
# number is -1, display 0 will be used, and if the display number is 1000,
# The number will be reduced to the largest display number present.
# scatter_display_id = 0

# Force the number of spectra displayed at the same time on Event Detail
# windows. If this parameter is commented out or missing, the tool will pick
# a value: 5 for really big displays (height > 2000), 3 for medium displays
# (height > 1200), and 1 for small displays (height < 1200).
# max_spec = 4

# If this parameter is present and evaluates to true (non-0 number, !true or
# true or t, case-insensitive), then NO spectra are displayed on the Event
# Detail plots. This is in case the user wants to see spectrograms ONLY
# much larger.
