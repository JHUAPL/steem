Welcome to the Spectrum Tool for Energetic Electrons at Mercury (STEEM)
STEEM is a tool for browsing a MESSENGER data set that contains data taken
with the Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS) instrument. This data set
is available through the PDS, but STEEM includes the data with the code.
The GRNS was found to be useful for detecting energetic electron events,
even though it was not originally designed for this purpose. STEEM provides
custom displays to allow the user to see how the spectra evolve in time,
and also how the various high-energy electon events are distributed as
a function of other metadata in the data set.
